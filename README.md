# E-College-Informatio-System


⚟ A System to manage administrative work of Students at College/Universities (Educational Institutions) Online and Reduce Paperwork.

⚟ This application has three modules. One is to be run and managed by Administration only and another is for Students and their parents.

⚟ This is only a Backend Project of Spring Boot.

⚟ This application will manage all kind of information of the students in a College. Via this application We can Store & Fetch (CRUD Operations) : All personal data related to Students, All information related to Courses, Subjects and Departments in Colleges, Fees related managements and Submission of Fees of Students, Management and Generation of Exam Record by administration , View Exam Results of Students and etc....

⚟ This is the first version of this Application, I'm working on expanding this application so that it can also be used to manage Teachers and Staff at Educational Institutions.

⚟ Technologies Used : *Core Java  *Spring Boot  *Spring Security  *Spring Data JPA  *Swagger API  *Jason Web Token (JWT)  *MySQL

⚟ How to Run: Run this code as Spring Boot application in Eclipse or IntelliJ, Just need to add database configuration in application.properties file according to your system and since JWT authentication mechanism is working in this app, you also need to create a user with Username & Password in DB manually and then you'll be good to go.
